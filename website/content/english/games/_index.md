I've been very actively participating in Ludum Dare back in the day, but the old LD website was lost to time, and games themselves were written in Java, so getting them to run today would take more effort than what nostalgia is worth.

The oldest game I've ever written (I was back in the highschool): [MyADOM](https://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=5329) (FreePascal)

The newest game that is easily found: [We Have Homunculus at Home](https://kibertoad.itch.io/we-have-homunculus-at-home) (TypeScript/Phaser.js)

In my spare time I'm currently working on a few new games. Stay tuned!
